Create a PL/SQL block to promote clerks who earn more than 3,000 to SR. CLERK and increase their salary by 10%. Use the EMP table for this practice. Verify the results by querying on the EMP table.
Hint: Use a cursor with FOR UPDATE and CURRENT OF syntax.


DECLARE
	CURSOR C_Senior_Clerk IS
	SELECT employee_id,job_id FROM emp
	WHERE job_id = 'ST_CLERK' AND salary > 3000
	FOR UPDATE OF job_id;
BEGIN
	FOR V_Emrec IN C_Senior_Clerk 
	LOOP
		UPDATE emp
		SET job_id = 'ST_CLERK',
		salary = 1.1 * salary
		WHERE CURRENT OF C_Senior_Clerk;
	END LOOP;
	COMMIT;
END;
