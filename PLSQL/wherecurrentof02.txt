Write a PL/SQL block to declare a variable called v_salary to store the salary of an employee. In the executable part of the program, do the following:
Store his or her salary in the v_salary variable
If the salary is less than 3,000, give the employee a raise of 500 and display the message '<Employee Name>’s salary updated' in the window.
If the salary is more than 3,000, print the employee’s salary in the format, '<Employee Name> earns …...………'
Test the PL/SQL for the last names
   
  DECLARE
   V_SALARY NUMBER(7,2);
   V_LASTNAME EMPLOYEES.LAST_NAME%TYPE;
   BEGIN
   SELECT salary INTO V_SALARY
   FROM employees 
  WHERE last_name = INITCAP('&&P_LASTNAME') FOR UPDATE of salary;	
  V_LASTNAME := INITCAP('&P_LASTNAME');
	IF V_SALARY < 3000 THEN
		UPDATE employees SET salary = salary + 500
		WHERE last_name =  INITCAP('&P_LASTNAME') ;
		DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (V_LASTNAME || '''s salary updated');
	ELSE
		DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (V_LASTNAME  || ' earns ' || 

TO_CHAR(V_SALARY));
	END IF;
END;
